    <h2 class="font-bold text-center text-xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl text-violet-400  pb-8">The Biopsychosocial Model of Disability</h2>
    
    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">The Biopsychosocial Model of Disability recognizes that disability is complex and includes the biological, individual, and social aspects of disability. The model is the basis for the World Health Organization's publication titled <em>International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)</em>.   </p>
    
    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">A strength of the model is that it takes into account the many facets of disability (biological, psychological, and social), leading to the development of a more robust support system for people with disabilities. However, combining health and social factors in defining disability may downplay the medical needs of people with disabilities.</p>
    
    <h2 class="font-bold text-center text-xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl text-violet-400 pt-16 pb-8">The Economic Model of Disability</h2>
    
    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">The Economic Model views disabilities from the perspective of the economic impact of the disability on individuals, employers, and the state. The model recognizes that disabilities affect a persons ability to work, which ultimately means that a person with a disability may earn less while having a higher cost for assistance. This in turn may cause an employer to have a lower profit margin and the state to have an increased welfare cost. </p>

    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">A strength of this model is that it recognizes the impact bodily limitations can have on a persons income. However, this model can create stigma towards a person who is labelled as disabled and in need of assistance. They may be negatively viewed as "needy" members of society. In this way, the Economic Model is related to the Charity Model. Additionally, many people have a disability that affects their ability to work, but they may not meet the criteria to be considered legally disabled and do not qualify for assistance.</p>
