    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">Today is Day One of my CPACC exam prep. I've been looking forward to starting this journey to certification for a while now. Everyday I'll be dedicating 2 hours to studying the recommended materials for the exam. My goal is to take the CPACC exam in April 2026, which gives me around 100 days of study time. On the CPACC webpage, in the <a class="underline underline-offset-8 text-violet-400 hover:text-white" href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/cpacc#Prepare%20for%20the%20CPACC%20Exam">Prepare for the CPACC Exam section</a>, it's suggested to study 5-10 hours a week for 6-8 weeks. In total, my plan affords 13 weeks of study at 10 hours per week (Mon. - Fri.). Giving myself a few extra weeks and weekends to recharge, I think it's a realistic timeline for my life at the moment.</p>
    
    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">I'm feeling a little stressed about the exam. It's been a while since I've had to study for a big exam. But I'm more excited than stressed to be working toward this certification. For the last year I've been a member of the Digital Accessibility Working Group at Goucher College and have stepped into the role of accessibility educator. I held a webinar for all web editors and content creators at the college&mdash;about 200 people in total&mdash;and the feedback was really encouraging.</p>
    
    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">I'll be using the recommended <a class="underline underline-offset-8 text-violet-400 hover:text-white " href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/sfsites/c/resource/CPACCBoK">CPACC Body of Knowledge</a> combined with Deque's CPACC Certification Prep course as my study materials. These materials seem to be the best for exam prep and have been used by many people I know who have already traveled this certification path. My goal is to eventually become a Certified Professional in Web Accessibility, which includes both the <a class="underline underline-offset-8 text-violet-400 hover:text-white" href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/cpacc">CPACC</a> and <a class="underline underline-offset-8 text-violet-400 hover:text-white" href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/was-exam">WAS</a> certifications. For now, I'll keep moving forward in this certification journey.</p>
