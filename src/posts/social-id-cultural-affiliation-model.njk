<section class="flex flex-col">

    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">People with disabilities may develop a sense of personal identity through interaction with others who share the same disability. The group can then develop a sense of culture based on these shared experiences.</p>
    
    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">The deaf community is a good example. A person in the deaf community may have a strong sense of social identity because of their shared common language, sign language. This makes perfect sense &ndash; it's easier to communicate with people who speak your language than with those who don't. The easier you can communicate the more you feel a sense of belonging. There are even deaf theater productions, deaf television shows, and other forms of deaf artistic expression that help to strengthen the shared culture.</p>

    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">Strengths of this model are:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8 ml-8">
        <li class="mb-8 "><strong>Self-Acceptance and Empowerment.</strong> Acceptance of one's disability is an important part of a persons emotional and psychological well-being. Having a support system of friends with disabilities can go along way to achieving acceptance and feeling valued.</li>
        <li class="mb-8 "><strong>Political.</strong> People can gain political strength by forming alliances and advocacy groups.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-center text-xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl text-violet-400 pt-16 pb-8">Weaknesses of the Social Id/Cultural Affiliation Model</h2>

    <p class="text-lg/loose md:text-xl/loose lg:text-2xl/loose max-w-prose mb-8">This model isn't always useful for technical definitions of disability because groups of people with different disabilities may consider themselves part of the same social group. Identifying strongly with other people who have disabilities may be a result of feeling excluded from the rest of society.</p>
